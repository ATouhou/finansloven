### FINANSLOV 2016

The source of the data is [Finansministeriets Finanslovsdatabase](http://www.oes-cs.dk/olapdatabase/finanslov/index.cgi)

More in depth description of each of the entries can be found under their appropriate paragraphs and subcategories in PDF 
format at [Finansministeriets website](https://www.fm.dk/publikationer/2016/finanslov-for-2016)

The first row in the `finanslov.dsv` dataset is a header row with names of the columns. For proper explanation of the columns refer to the original
database by Finansministeriet. 

All numbers are in millions as in the original database, however english decimals has ben set with dots instead of commas and the extra dot that delimited 
numbers by their thousands in the original dataset, has been removed. This is in order for easier processing with other programs.
